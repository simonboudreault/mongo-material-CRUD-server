# mongo-material-CRUD-server

this app is used to make the calls to the mongoDB database using shell commands. It uses express for the routes, joi for validation, jsonWebToken and passport for authentication and bcrypt for password hash.  Since this project was created for learning purposes, it has a way to trigger errors so they can be passed to the front-end to be displayed.
